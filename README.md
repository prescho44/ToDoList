# To-do List

## Target of users

Normal users, Family, teams etc.
The Idea is to have calendar that have in concrete day of the month to have list of todos in it. And link that can be generated that will be shareable and give access to todos list of this **Owner/Creator.** And will have roles:

> **Owner/Creator** - Create, Delete, Edit, Duplicate, check, uncheck
> **User** - check, uncheck, Create, Edit (**only his to-dos**)
> more roles will be available

## To-dos List Plan

To-dos to have page that render in more comfortable UI for reading of them.
Access to this page would be through _Calendar_ that every day of the month, week, day will be button.

## Calendar

Would have appearance of normal modern calendar, will have selectors (DD, MM, YYYY) that work one month before current month and 1-year after current month

> **Owner/Creator** - Add, Remove, Edit
> **User** - See and go to the to-dos for the selected day. only if **Owner/Creator** give access to it.
